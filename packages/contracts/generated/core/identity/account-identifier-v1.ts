 * GENERATED FILE — DO NOT EDIT. Your changes will be overwritten.

 * Source:    packages/contracts/core/identity/account-identifier-v1.schema.json
 * Generator: packages/contracts/generator/generate-types.mjs (docs/decisions/0037)
 * Contract:  *** status `proposed` — NOT ACCEPTED. ***
 *
 *            THE SOURCE CONTRACT IS NOT ACCEPTED, SO NOTHING BELOW IS AGREED. Types may
 *            change shape without a version bump, and ANY `*Permission` CONSTANT BELOW
 *            NAMES A PERMISSION THAT MAY NOT EXIST: docs/decisions/0007 rule 4 — a
 *            permission does not exist until it is in packages/contracts/registries/
 *            permission-catalog.yaml. Importing the name neither creates nor grants it,
 *            and a route gated on it will refuse every caller under deny-by-default.
 *            Build against this only if you are prepared to rewrite when it is accepted.
 *
 * Consumers import these types and NEVER re-declare them (0037 requirement 2). A hand-written
 * type that restates a generated one is the defect 0037 exists to remove, arriving one layer up.
 *
 * These are COMPILE-TIME types. A generated type says what the contract promises; it does not
 * check what arrived. Runtime validation on the server is Core's and is not made optional by a
 * client having good types.
